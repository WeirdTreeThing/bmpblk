# ChromeOS firmware bitmap block - board configuration.

# name1,name2,...:
#   key1: value ...
#   key2: value ...
#   ...
#
# name: List of board names for this configuration, separated by comma.
# keys are as follows:
#
# screen: Resolution of the framebuffer where firmware plots pixels
# panel: Display dimension. This is optional and used as a hint to adjust
#   image sizes for stretched displays. For a stretched display, narrower
#   images will be created so that displayed images will look proportional to
#   the original aspect ratio. If this is omitted, the panel dimension is
#   assumed to be the same as the framebuffer.
# bad_usb3: Presence of USB3 ports that cannot boot recovery
# locales: List of locales to include
# rtl: List of right-to-left locales
# hi_res: List of locales rendered in higher DPI. This should always contain
#   all locales unless flash space is limited.
# sdcard: Presence of SD/MMC Card Reader that can boot in recovery mode
# text_colors: Maximum number of colors for text images.
#
# Note the locale should be supported (and named) by Chrome browser:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/master/ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc
# In other words, iw should be 'he', and no should be 'nb'.

# Default configuration
# These are the values used unless set otherwise in the board specific config
