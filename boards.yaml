# ChromeOS firmware bitmap block - board configuration.
#
# name1,name2,...:
#   key1: value ...
#   key2: value ...
#   ...
#
# name: List of board names for this configuration, separated by comma.
# keys are as follows:
#
# screen: Resolution of the framebuffer where firmware plots pixels. If models
#   of a board have different resolutions, pick the maximum one.
# sdcard: Presence of SD/MMC Card Reader that can boot in recovery mode
# dpi: The DPI used when generating PNG files. With higher DPI, the generated
#   bitmaps will be larger and hence will take up more space in RO CBFS. When
#   adding a new board, please try the default DPI (by not specifying DPI)
#   first. If chromeos-bootimage fails to build because of bitmap size issue,
#   binary-search for the best-fitting DPI value.
# locales: List of locales to include
# rtl: List of right-to-left locales
# rw_override: List of names of localized bitmaps to be stored in both RW
#   and RO sections. This field is designed to allow late RW updates to change
#   or add bitmaps of firmware screens in RW. Currently, there is no support
#   for updating locale-independent bitmaps in vbgfx.bin and font.bin.
#
# Note the locale should be supported (and named) by Chrome browser:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/trunk/ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc
# In other words, iw should be 'he', and no should be 'nb'.

# Default configuration
# These are the values used unless set otherwise in the board specific config
_DEFAULT_:

  # consistent with the Chromebook Help Center
  # (https://support.google.com/chromebook).
  # Please modify this with care.
