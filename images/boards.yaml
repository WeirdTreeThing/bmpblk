# ChromeOS firmware bitmap block - board configuration.
#
# name1,name2,...:
#   key1: value ...
#   key2: value ...
#   ...
#
# name: List of board names for this configuration, seperated by comma.
# keys are as follows:
# 'assets_dir': Directory of image resources (icons and diagrams) to be used
#               (default: 'assets').
# 'assets_res': Screen resolution that best fits current assets
#               (default: [1366, 768]).
# 'bad_usb3': Presence of USB3 ports that cannot boot recovery (default: False).
# 'locales': List of locales to include (default: All locales).
# 'optional_screens': List of optional screens to include (default: None).
# 'panel': Panel Dimension (default: [1366, 768]).
# 'phy_rec': Presence of physical recovery button (default: False, check
#            http://crosbug.com/p/24963).
# 'res': Firmware graphics resolution (default: [1366, 768])
# 'sdcard': Presence of SD/MMC Card Reader that can boot in recovery mode
#           (default: True).
# 'text_colors': Max colors for text images (Default: 6 for scaled images,
#                otherwise 16. Set to zero for auto-detect). Decrease to reduce
#                output file size.
#
# These are all the known locales, sorted more-or-less geograpically
#  en es-419 pt-BR fr es pt-PT ca it de
#  el nl da nb(no) sv fi et lv lt ru pl cs sk hu sl sr hr bg ro
#  uk tr he(iw) ar fa hi th vi id fil zh-CN zh-TW ko ja
#
# Note the locale should be supported (and named) by Chrome browser:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/master/ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc
# In other words, iw should be 'he', and no should be 'nb'.
