This directory contains bitmap image sources used to create already shipping
systems. We don't expect to need these again, unless there's some emergency
needed by the factory flow that requires a change to the read-only BIOS
screens.

* To build new Alex bitmaps, check out "chromeos/autotest-private-x86-alex"
  on branch "0.11.241.B", and see the tools in
  client/site_tests/hardware_Components/utils.
