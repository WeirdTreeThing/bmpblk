This directory contains the original UTF-8 text from the l108 team. To
recreate the localized bitmaps, do this:

  cd localized_text
  make

Then to replace the current bitmaps with these new ones, do this:

  tar cf - */*.bmp | (cd ../../images/localized_images && tar xf -)
  rm -f */*.bmp

Note that automatically rendering text into images is not completely
reliable, so be sure to check the generated images carefully.
